DESCRIPTION
With the proper indent settings, Vim will mostly supply the correct amount of
indent when creating new lines. But sometimes, one needs a special amount of
indent, and it is cumbersome to manually create that by repeatedly pressing
<Tab>, <Space>, and <BS>.

This plugin defines insert mode mappings that indent a new line exactly at the
current cursor position, or insert the indent used in adjacent lines, or align
the text to the right of the cursor to text fragments in surrounding lines.

To duplicate the text of adjacent lines, Vim has the i_CTRL-E / i_CTRL-Y
commands. But these only work character for character (which makes it slow to
copy longer fragments), and fail when empty / shorter lines surround the
current line.

This plugin supercharges these commands, making them look beyond the immediate
lines. With a separate mapping, the scope of completion can be toggled between
single characters and whole words, speeding up larger text grabs while still
allowing the fine-grained completion.

SOURCE
- The i_CTRL-E / i_CTRL-Y mappings are based on
    http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-vim-script-1/index.html

RELATED WORKS
- The prev_indent plugin (vimscript #4575) provides an insert mode mapping and
  :PrevIndent to move the current line to the previous indentation level.

USAGE
CTRL-Enter              Insert newline and indent the new line to the current
                        cursor column. This takes into account indent-
                        expressions and insertion of the comment leader.

CTRL-E / CTRL-Y         Insert the character from unfolded lines below / above
                        the cursor; if the adjacent line is not that long,
                        look beyond. The command beeps and suspends insert
                        once if the current target line has been exhausted.

CTRL-G CTRL-E / CTRL-G CTRL-Y
                        Insert an entire word from unfolded lines below /
                        above the cursor and toggle the behavior of i_CTRL-E
                        / i_CTRL-Y to continue inserting words. The behavior
                        reverts itself when inserting in another line or by
                        using this mapping a second time.

CTRL-G CTRL-U           Insert the indent from the next nearby unfolded line
                        that has at least as much indent as the current cursor
                        position. If the indent before and after the current
                        line differs, the smaller amount is inserted; repeat
                        the mapping to get the larger amount.
                        (Mnemonic: Undo the effect of i_CTRL-U.)

CTRL-G CTRL-D           Remove whitespace before the cursor so that the
                        current cursor position aligns with the start of
                        preceding non-whitespace text in the previous unfolded
                        line.

CTRL-G CTRL-T           Insert whitespace so that the text after the cursor
                        aligns with the start of following non-whitespace text
                        in the previous unfolded line.
